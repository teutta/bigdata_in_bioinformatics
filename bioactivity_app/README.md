Python library called Streamlit will allow us to develop a simple data-driven application for this project
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

### Create conda environment
Firstly, we will create a conda environment called *big_data*
```
conda create -n big_data 
```
Secondly, we will login to the *big_data* environement
```
conda activate big_data
```
### Install prerequisite libraries

For this project we will need to install the following  libraries

Pip install
```
streamlit
pandas
base58
subprocess
os
pickle

```

### Generating the PKL file

The machine learning model used in this web app will firstly have to be generated by successfully running the included Jupyter notebook "bioactivity_prediction_app.ipynb" Upon successfully running all code cells, a pickled model called acetylcholinesterase_model.pkl will be generated.

###  Launch the app
First we have to navigate to the folder were the app.py is
Second to launch the app we have to type the following  commands in conda environement.

```
streamlit run app.py
```
